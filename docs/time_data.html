<p><em>Note: In this analysis, 11 cities are considered, with annual
changes in rankings due to variations in net worth. Net worth serves as
the 5 sorting criterion and the decline noted in 2023 is likely a result
of incomplete data.</em></p>
<p>The data indicates that while cities like Medina and Omaha remain
consistent high performers, there’s a dynamic shift with other cities
like Austin and Seattle showing rapid growth, indicating a possible
diversification in the geographical distribution of wealth.</p>

<p>The line graph shows the changes in a billionaire’s net worth from
2010 to 2023, generally increasing but with significant drops in 2016
and 2020. These drops were probably caused by market problems and the
financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the decrease in 2020,
there was a sharp increase, reaching the highest point in 2021.</p>

<p>The chart comparing billionaires’ net worth from 2010 to 2023 in five
key regions shows the USA’s significant growth, particularly after 2015.
China demonstrates rapid, albeit fluctuating, wealth accumulation.
Germany exhibits consistent growth, while India’s rise mirrors its
economic development. Hong Kong, however, saw growth followed by a
decline after 2019. This data reflects diverse economic trends and the
influence of regional and global factors on wealth.</p>

<p>The second line graph shows the net worth by gender from 2010 to
2023. The net worth of male billionaires is significantly higher than
that of females throughout the period, with a particularly steep
increase for males after 2015. The consistent gap and the sharp rise in
male net worth could be due to a combination of factors, including the
compounding effect of existing wealth, gender disparities in key
industries, and potentially more males being active in high-growth
sectors such as technology and finance.</p>
